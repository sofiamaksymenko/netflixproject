# Netflix Data Analysis 

This project analyzes the Netflix content catalog from the years **2008 to 2021**, focusing on the release patterns of **TV Series vs. Films**. The dataset was cleaned, explored, and visualized using tools such as Tableau.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to:

* Understand trends in content release over time
* Compare the volume of **Movies** vs **TV series**
* Identify geographic distribution of releases
* Analyze spikes or anomalies in content output

## Key Insights

* **More films** were released compared to TV series during the period.
* The majority of content was released in **North America** and **Europe**.
* **2020** had the highest number of releases, likely impacted by the **COVID-19 pandemic**, which shifted production and release strategies.

  ## Additional Findings
* Content acquisition timeline: a sharp increase in content began around 2016, coinciding with Netflix's global expansion to 130+ new countries.
* Reduced acquisition lag: initially, content took several years to appear on Netflix post-release. By 2016, that lag had significantly decreased, suggesting faster licensing and original production.
* Dominant genres: the most frequent genres were Drama, Documentary, and Comedy, reflecting Netflix's broad storytelling strategy.
* Top countries: the United States, India, and the United Kingdom were the top contributors to Netflix's content. In contrast, countries like Japan and South Korea showed a stronger emphasis on TV shows.
* Pandemic spike: a surge in 2020 releases likely corresponds to higher demand for streaming content during global lockdowns.
